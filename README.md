[@deepanswerbot](https://twitter.com/deepanswerbot)

Responds to [@deepquestionbot](https://twitter.com/deepquestionbot) with answers. It detects the type of question being asked, what the key subjects are and then generates an answer using [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu).

### Examples

> @deepquestionbot: Why must rats be rodents? Why does a rabbit have to be a pet?

> @deepanswerbot: It is wrong always, everywhere and for everyone, to believe anything upon insufficient rabbit
